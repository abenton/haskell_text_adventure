Simple text adventure game engine written in Haskell.

The configuration files to start a game are in the extras directory. 

The generated_parser.txt file in the extras directory contains a dump from
the GHC compiler of the parser that Data.Aeson generates. The dump was obtained
by running the command "gch -ddump-splices -c Types.hs"

NOTE: This application requires Data.Aeson and TemplateHaskell
